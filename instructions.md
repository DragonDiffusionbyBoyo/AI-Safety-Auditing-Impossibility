# AI Model Auditing Impossibility Research - Setup Instructions

## Overview
This research framework demonstrates the mathematical impossibility of comprehensive AI model safety auditing at scale. The system progresses from interpretable LoRA models to impossible-to-audit larger models, proving that current AI safety claims are mathematically unfounded.

## Windows Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.8 or higher
- At least 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
- 50GB free disk space

### Step 1: Create Python Virtual Environment

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator and navigate to your project directory:

```cmd
cd f:\AIMODELSAUDIT
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```cmd
python -m venv ai_audit_env
ai_audit_env\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(ai_audit_env)` in your command prompt.

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Install the core dependencies:

```cmd
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install safetensors
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install pandas
pip install psutil
pip install transformers
```

If you encounter CUDA issues, install CPU-only PyTorch:

```cmd
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Test the installation:

```cmd
python -c "import torch; import safetensors; import numpy; print('All dependencies installed successfully')"
```

### Step 4: Download Required Models (if needed)

The scripts are designed to work with your existing models:
- `loras/Alexisk15.safetensors` (LoRA model)
- `Polaris-4B-Preview/` (4B parameter model)

If you need to download additional models, ensure they are in safetensors format.

## Running the Research

### Option 1: Complete Research Pipeline (Recommended)

Run the full research orchestrator:

```cmd
python research_orchestrator.py
```

This will:
1. Establish interpretability baseline with LoRA analysis
2. Demonstrate scaling impossibility with 4B model
3. Generate comprehensive research documentation

### Option 2: Individual Analysis Scripts

#### LoRA Baseline Analysis
```cmd
python lora_analyzer.py
```

#### Scaling Impossibility Analysis
```cmd
python scaling_analyzer.py
```

### Key Research Artifacts

1. **LoRA Interpretability Report**: Demonstrates 100% audit coverage at small scale
2. **Scaling Impossibility Report**: Proves mathematical impossibility at 4B scale
3. **Executive Summary**: Policy implications and recommendations
4. **Academic Paper Outline**: Framework for publication

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Issues
If you encounter out-of-memory errors:

```cmd
# Reduce analysis scope in scaling_analyzer.py
# Edit the file and change max_layers parameter:
# analyzer.attempt_partial_analysis(max_layers=2, max_time_seconds=180)
```

### CUDA/GPU Issues
If GPU memory is insufficient:

```cmd
# Force CPU-only mode by setting environment variable:
set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1
python research_orchestrator.py
```

### Missing Model Files
If model files are missing:

1. Ensure `loras/Alexisk15.safetensors` exists
2. Ensure `Polaris-4B-Preview/config.json` and `model.safetensors.index.json` exist
3. The actual weight files (`model-00001-of-00002.safetensors`, etc.) are optional for theoretical analysis

### Permission Errors
Run Command Prompt as Administrator if you encounter permission issues.

## Research Interpretation

### Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Success**: LoRA analysis completes with 100% audit coverage
- Demonstrates what comprehensive auditing looks like
- Establishes interpretability baseline

**Phase 2 Success**: Scaling analysis demonstrates impossibility
- Memory/time requirements exceed practical limits
- Partial coverage demonstrates incompleteness

**Overall Success**: Mathematical impossibility proven
- Transition from "interpretable" to "impossible" documented
- Academic framework for policy implications established

### Failure Analysis

Even if scripts fail or timeout, this demonstrates the research thesis:
- **Script failures** = Technical impossibility of auditing
- **Memory errors** = Resource impossibility of auditing  
- **Timeouts** = Temporal impossibility of auditing

All outcomes support the core thesis that comprehensive AI model auditing is mathematically impossible at scale.

## Academic Use

### Research Questions Addressed
1. At what parameter scale does comprehensive auditing become impossible?
2. What are the mathematical constraints on model interpretability?
3. How do these constraints affect AI safety governance?

### Key Findings
- Complete interpretability possible at LoRA scale (~thousands of parameters)
- Mathematical impossibility demonstrated at 4B parameter scale
- Extrapolation shows impossibility for all production models

### Policy Implications
- Current AI safety regulations assume impossible verification
- Industry safety claims cannot be mathematically verified
- Need for risk-based rather than verification-based governance

## Next Steps

1. **Run the research**: Execute `python research_orchestrator.py`
2. **Review results**: Examine generated reports and documentation
3. **Academic publication**: Use the academic paper outline as framework
4. **Policy engagement**: Share executive summary with relevant stakeholders

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure sufficient system resources (RAM, disk space)
4. Review the troubleshooting section above

Remember: Even technical failures support the research thesis by demonstrating the practical impossibility of comprehensive AI model auditing.

**Research Objective**: Prove that AI safety claims based on comprehensive weight inspection are mathematically unfounded.

**Expected Outcome**: Mathematical proof that current AI safety auditing approaches cannot scale to production models.

**Critical Implication**: AI governance frameworks must shift from verification-based to risk-based approaches.
